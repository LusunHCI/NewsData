He urged the nighttime crowd, \u201cLet\u2019s make this real!\u201d\n\u201cThis is really some wild stuff here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, hard to believe it's real.\u201d\nNASA plans to use the fully reusable Starship to land astronauts on the moon as early as 2025. Musk, meanwhile, hopes to deploy a fleet of Starships to create a city on Mars, hauling equipment and people there.\nFor now, the initial flights would carry Musk's internet satellites, called Starlinks, into orbit.\n\u201cThere will probably be a few bumps in the road, but we want to iron those out with satellite missions and test missions\u201d before putting people on board, he said.\nSpaceX's Super Heavy first-stage booster has yet to blast off. But the futuristic, bullet-shaped, steel Starship \u2014 perched on top and serving as the upper stage \u2014 successfully launched and landed on its own last May, following a series of spectacular explosions. The rocketship soared more than 6 miles (10 kilometers).\nSpaceX is awaiting approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before proceeding with Starship's next phase: going into orbit. Musk said he expects the go-ahead in March and that the rocket should be ready to fly by then as well. That would put the launch in the next couple of months, he added.\nIf the FAA demands more information about potential environmental impacts or lawsuits emerge, Musk said Starship launches could move to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But that would delay the first orbital launch by more than half a year, he noted.\nThe full-size Starships are massive \u2014 taller than NASA's past and present moon rockets, with approximately double the liftoff thrust.\nBesides Florida's Cape Canaveral and the southern tip of Texas near Boca Chica, Starships could ultimately launch from floating ocean platforms anywhere in the world, Musk said. He envisions Starships launching three times a day \u2014 \u201crapid reusability\" \u2014 with refilling stations in space for the longer destinations like Mars. The first refilling test could happen by the end of next year, he said.\nMusk estimates a Starship launch could wind up costing less than $10 million \u2014 maybe even just a few million dollars with a high flight rate, which would bring down prices. He called it \u201ccrazy low\u201d and \u201cridiculously good\u201d by current space standards.\nStarship already has one private customer: a Japanese entrepreneur who has bought a flight around the moon and plans to take a dozen artists with him. Musk hinted there are others interested in buying trips, saying future announcements would be forthcoming.\nUntil now, SpaceX has relied on its much smaller Falcon rockets to launch satellites, as well as astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station for NASA. Its first private flight, purchased by a billionaire, was last September. Another is coming up at the end of March, this one to the space station with three businessmen who are paying $55 million apiece.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/spacexs-elon-musk-1st-orbital-starship-flight-march-82816148?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
