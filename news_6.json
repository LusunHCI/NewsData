But Mr Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, is also likely to want the company to be profitable.\n\u201cI think there is nothing better for Twitter than Elon Musk buying it and ideally replacing the board, and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue-generating sources,\u201d technology entrepreneur and investor John Meyer said earlier this week.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-revenue-b2067508.html?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
