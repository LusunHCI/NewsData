The court determined that individual Russians will not be held responsible for \u201cextremism\u201d by continuing to use Facebook and Instagram, TASS reported.\nThe order follows Russia's announcement March 4 that it would block access to Facebook and Twitter after Meta banned several state media accounts.\nMeta will now be prohibited from opening branches in Russia and from doing business in Russia, TASS said. The Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office cited calls for violence against Russian citizens on Meta-owned platforms as a reason for the ban.\nOn March 10, Reuters reported that internal Facebook emails said Meta would allow users in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion, which Reuters said marked a shift away from the platform's hate speech policy.\nA spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.\nThe ban is another step in Kremlin-led institutions efforts to fight back against U.S. social media platforms in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Disinformation experts said that Russia's state-led campaigns to push false narratives around the invasion have ramped up since the conflict began in late February.\nMeta owns and operates social media platforms and communication apps including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. TASS reported that WhatsApp will not be banned under the new decision.\nAnother Russian state media organization, Interfax, reported that a Meta representative was present at Russia\u2019s hearings and argued that the country did not have judicial oversight over a foreign company.\nWhatsApp was one of the most popular apps in Russia in 2021, used by 65 percent of internet users in the country, according to data published by Insider Intelligence. Al-Jazeera reported in March that WhatsApp use in Russia outpaced that of Telegram, another messaging platform that Russian state media uses to publish official government communications.\nOn March 18, Russia\u2019s official Telegram channel for the government\u2019s telecommunications regulator posted that social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u201chave been subject to restrictions in many countries\u201d as a result of \u201ccontent filtering conditions.\u201d The same Telegram channel has been used since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to condemn social media platforms\u2019 actions taken against Russian content and Russian users.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/russian-court-bans-facebook-instagram-extremism-law-rcna20872?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
