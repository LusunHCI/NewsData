This also includes European countries that are not allied with Russia.\nZalvany's comments were a proposal and are not a confirmed action.\n\"The set of currencies may vary, and that\u2019s normal practice. If there are bitcoins \u2013 we will trade in bitcoins,\" said Zalvany.\nThe announcement resulted in climbing gas prices in Europe as buyersaround the world have opted out of consuming Russian oil as a way to sanction the country.\nZalvany said that all the contracts they have will still be in place, and nothing changes in their obligations. However, if they do not pay with the accepted currency, then Russia will not supply oil.\n\u201cGas is just the beginning, this will also affect other resources. If they want to buy, let them pay either in hard currency, for us that\u2019s gold, or in currencies that are convenient for us, that\u2019s the national currency,\u201d Zalvany said.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/03/25/russia-bitcoin-payment-oil/7165901001/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
