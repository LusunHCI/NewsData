Without that, \u201cfreedom will never be complete,\u201d Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe said.\n\u201cIt has been cruel what happened to me,\u201d Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe said. But, she added, although her release had taken a long time, others remained in prison and she \u201cwas the lucky one who got to be recognized internationally.\u201d", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/world/europe/iran-uk-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-released.html?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
