TIME then details further:\nThe dosage for this age group is one-quarter of that currently approved for adults. Children vaccinated with the shot produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at similar levels to those that adults made after being vaccinated at higher doses, likely reflecting children\u2019s more active and efficient immune systems. Those antibodies led to an efficacy of 43.7% in protecting children six months to two years old from getting infected with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, and 37.5% among those aged two to six. None of the children in the study who became infected experienced severe disease, were hospitalized, or died.\nTIME reports the new Omicron subvariant, BA.2, continues to cause more new infections, and virus control measures like mask-wearing are being dropped in schools and other public places throughout the U.S..", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/health/2022/03/23/moderna-seeks-urgent-approval-to-vaccinate-very-young-children/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
