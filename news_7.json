Forget 1.5 degrees, they say. Earth is still on a path to exceed 2 degrees (3.6 Fahrenheit).\n\u201cThe 1.5C goal was already on life support before Glasgow and now it\u2019s about time to declare it dead,\u201d Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheim told The Associated Press in an email Sunday.\nA few of the 13 scientists the AP interviewed about the Glasgow pact said they see just enough progress to keep alive the 1.5-degree Celsius limit \u2014 and with it, some hope. But barely.\nThe optimists point to many agreements that came out of Glasgow, including a United States-China deal to work harder together to cut emissions this decade, as well as separate multi-nation agreements that target methane emissions and coal-fired power. After six years of failure, a market-based mechanism would kick-start trading credits that reduce carbon in the air.\nThe 1.5-degree mark is the more stringent of two targets from the historic 2015 Paris climate accord. United Nations officials and scientists consider it key because a 2018 scientific report found dramatically worse effects on the world after 1.5 degrees.\nThe world has already warmed 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial time, so this is really about a few tenths of a degree more. The United Nations calculated that to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, countries need to cut their emissions in half by 2030. Emissions are now going up, not down, by about 14% since 2010, Espinosa said.\nGerman researcher Hans-Otto Portner said the Glasgow conference \u201cgot work done, but did not make enough progress.\"\n\"Warming will by far exceed 2 degrees Celsius. This development threatens nature, human life, livelihoods, habitats and also prosperity,\u201d said Portner, who co-chairs one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific reports the United Nations relies on.\nInstead of big changes in bending the temperature curve as the United Nations had hoped for from Glasgow, they got only tiny tweaks, according to scientists who run computer simulations.\n\u201cHeading out of Glasgow we have shaved maybe 0.1C off of warming ... for a best-estimate of 2.3C warming,\" Breakthrough Institute climate scientist and director Zeke Hausfather said in an email. Hausfather has done climate modeling with colleagues for Carbon Brief.\nMIT professor Jon Sterman said his Climate Interactive team crunched some preliminary numbers after the Glasgow deal came out and it didn\u2019t match leaders\u2019 optimism.\n\u201cThere is no plausible way to limit warming to 1.5 or even 2 (degrees) if coal is not phased out ... and as rapidly as possible, along with oil and gas,\u201d he said.\nOn Saturday, India got a last-minute change to the pact: Instead of the \u201cphase out\u201d of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, the subsidies are to be \u201cphased down.\u201d Several of the scientists said that regardless of what the deal says, coal needs to end, not just decrease, to lessen future warming.\n\u201c\u2018Lessening\u2019 will do less to slow the harmful effects of climate change than \u2018eliminating,\u2019\u201d former NASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati, who runs environmental research at the University of Colorado, said in an email.\nBefore the pact was finished, Climate Action Tracker, which also analyzes pledges to see how much warming they would lead to, said emission-cut pledges would lead to 2.4 degrees of warming.\nThe 1.5 figure \u201cis balanced on a knife edge,\u201d said tracker scientist Bill Hare of Australia.\nOne paragraph in the pact \u2014 which calls on countries whose emission-cutting goals aren\u2019t in line with 1.5- or 2- degree limits to come back with new stronger goals by the end of next year \u2014 gives hope, Hare said.\nBut U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Saturday night that paragraph probably doesn\u2019t apply to the United States, the second-largest coal emitter and the largest historically, because the U.S. goal is so strong.\nJonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist who is dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s environment school said the pact provided \u201cwatered down hope. ... We got an incomplete plan for slower action.\u201d\n\u201cI went into the (conference) thinking 1.5C was still alive, and it appears the world\u2019s leaders just didn\u2019t have the backbone for that,\u201d Overpeck said in an email.\nSome progress was made, said University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, one of the key authors of the U.S. national climate assessment. \u201cBut the probability of getting to 1.5 degrees is much reduced, even to the point of almost being impossible. Even being able to get to 2 degrees is less likely.\u201d\nBut some scientists held out hope.\n\u201cFor the first time, I can really see a potential path forward to limiting warming to 1.5C,\u201d Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said in an email. \u201cBut it will require both (a) countries making good on their current pledges and (b) further ratcheting up their current commitments.\u201d\nJohan Rockstr\u00f6m of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact and Research in Germany highlighted the \u201coptimistic\u201d scenario he and a few others see if all the countries that have promised net-zero emissions by mid-century actually achieve the goal \u2014 something most haven\u2019t started concrete action on.\nIn that case, warming could be limited to 1.8 degrees or 1.9 degrees, Rockstr\u00f6m said.\n\u201cThat is a significant progress, but far from sufficient,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow AP\u2019s climate coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
