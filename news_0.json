Two kid-size shots \u201cwill safely protect them. I think it is likely that over time they will need additional doses. But we\u2019re working on that\u201d.\nNow, only children ages five or older can be vaccinated in the US, using rival Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, leaving 18 million younger children unprotected.\nModerna\u2019s vaccine isn\u2019t the only one in the race. Pfizer is soon expected to announce if three of its even smaller-dose shots work for the littlest children, months after the disappointing discovery that two doses weren\u2019t quite strong enough.\nWhether it\u2019s one company\u2019s shots or both, FDA vaccine chief Dr Peter Marks said the agency will \u201cmove quickly without sacrificing our standards\u201d in deciding if child-sized doses are safe and effective.\nWhile questions are swirling about what\u2019s taking so long, Marks pointedly told lawmakers this week that the FDA can\u2019t evaluate a product until a manufacturer completes its application. FDA will publicly debate the evidence with its scientific advisers before making a decision, and Marks said multiple meetings would be scheduled to cover several expected applications.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important that we have the proper evaluation so that parents will have trust in any vaccines that we authorize,\u201d Marks told a Senate committee.\nIf FDA clears vaccinations for the littlest, next the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would have to recommend who needs them \u2013 all children or just those at higher risk from Covid-19.\nMany parents are desperate for whichever vaccine gets to the scientific finish line first.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been kind of left behind as everybody else moves on,\u201d said Meagan Dunphy-Daly, a Duke University marine biologist whose six-year-old daughter is vaccinated \u2013 but whose three-year-old and 18-month-old sons are part of Pfizer\u2019s trial.\nThe FDA will face some complex questions.\nIn a study of kids ages six months through five years, two Moderna shots \u2013 each a quarter of the regular dose \u2013 triggered high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, the same amount proven to protect young adults, Burton of Moderna said. There were no serious side effects, and the shots triggered fewer fevers than other routine vaccinations.\nBut the vaccine proved between about 40% and 50% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 during the trial. Burton blamed the Omicron variant\u2019s ability to partially evade vaccine immunity, noting that unboosted adults showed similarly less effectiveness against milder Omicron infections. While no children became severely ill during the study, he said high antibody levels are a proxy for protection against more serious illness \u2013 and the company will test a child booster dose.\nAnother problem: so far in the US, Moderna\u2019s vaccine is restricted to adults. Other countries have expanded the shot to kids as young as six. But months ago the FDA cited concern about a rare side effect, heart inflammation, in teen boys, and it hasn\u2019t ruled on Moderna\u2019s earlier pediatric applications.\nBurton said the FDA may consider its vaccine for children of all ages \u2013 but also might open it first to the youngest kids who have no other option. He said safety data from millions of older children given Moderna vaccinations abroad should help reassure parents.\nWhile Covid-19 generally isn\u2019t as dangerous in children as adults, some do become severely ill or even die. About 475 children younger than five have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic\u2019s start, according to the CDC, and child hospitalizations soared at Omicron\u2019s peak.\nYet it\u2019s not clear how many parents intend to vaccinate the youngest kids. Less than a third of children ages five to 11 have had two vaccinations, and 58% of those ages 12 to 17.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/moderna-asks-us-authorize-covid-19-vaccine-children-under-age-six?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
