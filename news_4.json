So we are right on track now to diversify away from Russian gas.\"\nThe EU gets 40% of its gas from Russia. If it's to wean itself off that dependency, it needs to get its energy elsewhere.\nThe question is, where from?\nGas is already piped from Norway - but those pipelines are already operating at maximum capacity. The EU gets relatively little from the North Sea.\nNew supplies will have to come from further afield, in the form of LNG - gas that's been chilled and liquified.\nBut there's already intense competition for LNG supplies from countries such as Algeria and Qatar, and that's been pushing up prices.\nThe 50 billion cubic metres of gas a year from the US - more than double the current quantity - would certainly be welcome.\nBut it still wouldn't fill the gap if Russian supplies were removed.\nThere are also question marks over how much gas the US can supply, how quickly it can increase exports to the EU - and how much those shipments will cost.\nThe EU has been enjoying cheap gas for many years - but now it seems to have accepted that era is coming to an end.\nRussia's war with Ukraine has helped push energy prices to record highs.\nEnergy prices were already rising before the invasion as economies started to recover from the Covid crisis.\nThe Ukraine invasion prompted the EU to pledge to cut Russian gas use by two-thirds this year by hiking imports from other countries and boosting renewable energy.\nThe White House said that greater energy efficiency can be immediately achieved through increasing the use of smart thermostats and heat pumps.\nThe EU said that reductions through energy savings in homes can replace 15.5 billion cubic metres this year and that accelerating wind and solar deployment can replace 20 billion cubic metres.\nThe EU's goal is to save 170 billion cubic metres by 2030 through energy efficiency and by using renewable energy.\nThat 170 billion on top of the planned 50 billion of additional gas from the US and other countries means Europe's reliance on Russian gas could be replaced by 2030.\nRussia sanctions\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.\nThe EU has said it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy \"well before 2030\".\nGermany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open.\nMeanwhile in the UK petrol prices have hit record highs as oil and gas costs soar.\nOil jumped to $139 a barrel at one point earlier this month, the highest level for almost 14 years, while wholesale gas prices for next-day delivery more than doubled.\n\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60871601?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
