She said it is \u201cimportant to me to represent that the children\u2019s voices are represented.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was the first of two days of questioning after Jackson and the 22 members of the panel gave opening statements on Monday. On Thursday, the committee will hear from legal experts before an eventual vote to move her nomination to the Senate floor.\nBarring unexpected developments, Democrats who control the Senate by the slimmest of margins hope to wrap up Jackson\u2019s confirmation before Easter, though Breyer is not leaving the court until after the current session ends this summer.\nIn what Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., described as \u201ca trial by ordeal,\u201d Jackson answered questions right off the bat that attempted to deflect GOP concerns and also highlight the empathetic style that she has frequently described when she is handing down sentences. Republicans planned to use their questioning to brand Jackson \u2014 and Democrats in general \u2014 as soft on crime, an emerging theme in GOP midterm election campaigns.\nJackson told the committee that her brother and two uncles served as police officers, and \u201ccrime and the effect on the community, and the need for law enforcement \u2014 those are not abstract concepts or political slogans to me.\u201d\nShe also defended work she did around 15 years ago as a public defender and later in private practice representing four Guantanamo Bay detainees. While some Republicans have complained that Jackson was defending terrorists, she noted that defenders don\u2019t pick their clients and are \u201cstanding up for the constitutional value of representation.\u201d She said she continued to represent one client in private practice because her firm happened to be assigned his case.\nShe bristled at questions from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who voted for her confirmation as an appeals court judge last year but has openly expressed his frustration after President Joe Biden picked her over a South Carolina judge. Graham asked her about her religion, and how often she goes to church, in emotional comments about what he said was unfair criticism of Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Catholicism ahead of her 2020 confirmation.\nJackson \u2014 who thanked God in her opening statement and said that her faith \u201csustains me at this moment\u201d \u2014 responded that she is a Protestant. But she said she is reluctant to talk about her faith in detail because \u201cI want to be mindful of the need for the public to have confidence in my ability to separate out my personal views.\u201d\nDemocrats have been full of praise for Biden\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, noting that she would not only be the first Black woman but also the first public defender on the court, and first with experience representing indigent criminal defendants since Justice Thurgood Marshall.\nCommittee Chairman Durbin said that to be first, \u201coften, you have to be the best, in some ways the bravest.\u201d\nBiden chose Jackson in February, fulfilling a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court for the first time in American history. She would take the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced in January that he would retire after 28 years on the court.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., spoke emotionally about the \u201cjoy\u201d he felt about her historic nomination and acknowledged her family\u2019s pride. Jackson would be the third Black justice, after Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman.\nBooker, who is Black, said the white men who have sat on the Supreme Court for two centuries were \u201cextraordinary patriots who helped shape this country\u201d but that many people could have never dreamed of sitting on the court.\nJackson, who grew up in Miami, noted that she did not have to attend racially segregated public schools like her own parents did, \u201cand the fact that we had come that far was to me a testament to the hope and the promise of this country, the greatness of America that in one generation we could go from racially segregated schools in Florida to have me sitting here as the first Floridian ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\nOn Monday, Democrats on the Judiciary panel sought to preemptively rebut Republican criticism of Jackson\u2019s record on criminal matters as a judge, as a federal public defender and a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency created by Congress to reduce disparity in federal prison sentences.\nJackson \u201cis not anti-law enforcement\u201d and is not \u201csoft on crime,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, noting that her support from some national police organizations. \u201dJudge Jackson is no judicial activist.\u201d\nQuestions about her sentences for child pornographers first came from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who said in his opening statement that his research showed that she had a pattern of issuing lower sentences in child pornography cases, repeating comments he wrote in a Twitter thread last week. The Republican National Committee echoed his claims in blast messages to supporters.\nThe White House, along with several Democrats at the hearing, has rejected Hawley\u2019s criticism as \u201ctoxic and weakly presented misinformation.\u201d Sentencing expert Douglas Berman, an Ohio State law professor, wrote on his blog that Jackson\u2019s record shows she is skeptical of the range of prison terms recommended for child pornography cases, \u201cbut so too were prosecutors in the majority of her cases and so too are district judges nationwide.\u201d\nHawley is one of several committee Republicans, along with Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who are potential 2024 presidential candidates, and their aspirations may collide with other Republicans who would prefer not to pursue a scorched-earth approach to Jackson\u2019s nomination.\nJackson appeared before the Judiciary committee last year after Biden chose her to fill an opening on the federal appeals court in Washington . She was also vetted by the committee and confirmed by the Senate as a district court judge under President Barack Obama and to her post on the sentencing commission.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-hearing-day-2-live-updates-219ce62acd87ca205163781f5b6623a0?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
