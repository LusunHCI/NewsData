Zavalny said that Russia is willing to be more flexible with payment options with friendly nations - pointing to China and Turkey, news agency CNBC reported.\n\u201cWe have been proposing to China for a long time to switch to settlements in national currencies for rubles and yuan. With Turkey, it will be lira and rubles,\u201d Zavalny was quoted as saying by CNBC.\n\u201cYou can also trade bitcoins. If they want to buy, let them pay either in hard currency, and this is gold for us, or pay as it is convenient for us, this is the national currency,\u201d Zavalny then went on to add.\nFollowing this announcement, Bitcoin prices soared over the last 24 hours to 4% climbing up to $44,000 and its price soared around the time reports of Zavalny\u2019s announcement surfaced.\nThe Duma committee also reiterated Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s desire to make \u2018unfriendly\u2019 nations pay for gas in Russia\u2019s currency. Following Putin\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, prices of oil soared all over Europe causing further uncertainty in an already-stressed energy market.\nThe European Union (EU) is uncertain whether it will stop importing Russian oil in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Much of western Europe depends on Russian energy exports especially during winter due to extreme cold. People familiar with the developments told news agency CNBC that unlike the United States (US) the European Union may not ban importing Russian oil.\nNic Carter, a founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, an early-stage firm focused on cryptocurrency and the co-founder of Coin Metrics said that Russia appears to be serious from moving away from the dollar and it was preparing for that kind of transition since 2014 when it began divesting in US Treasurys. Putin once in 2021 said that he was not convinced that bitcoin could replace the US dollar in settling oil trades. But the Kremlin is now considering it as a form of payment for major exports.", "url": "https://www.news18.com/news/world/russia-may-accept-bitcoin-for-oil-gas-exports-to-mitigate-damage-caused-by-sanctions-4906208.html?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
