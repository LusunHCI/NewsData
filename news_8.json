I was told early on that there is something they want [off] the Brits, and they're not going to let me go until such time as they get that. I didn't know the details at the time.\"\nThe 43-year-old thanked her \"amazing, wonderful\" husband Richard for \"tirelessly\" campaigning over her release and her daughter Gabriella \"for being very, very patient with mummy to be coming home\".", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/03/21/boris-johnson-news-russia-ukraine-sunak-cost-living/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
