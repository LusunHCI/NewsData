The billionaire has floated moves including relying less on advertising to generate revenue and loosening content-moderation rules that could impact ad placement and the user experience.\nTwitter said Thursday that it was withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlooks, and it wouldn\u2019t provide any forward-looking guidance. Before Mr. Musk\u2019s courtship, Twitter had been working to achieve three main goals by the end of 2023: to surpass $7.5 billion in annual revenue, reach 315 million daily users and double the pace at which it produces new technology.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What does Twitter\u2019s earnings report suggest about the company\u2019s long-term health? Join the conversation below.\nBecause of its pending sale to Mr. Musk, announced Monday, Twitter said it wouldn\u2019t host a conference call with analysts to discuss the results.\nAt an all-hands employee meeting late Monday, Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal said that no layoffs were planned and the company\u2019s priorities aren\u2019t changing before the deal closes, according to a person who heard the remarks.\nIn what may be one of its final earnings reports as a public company, Twitter said its daily user base rose to 229 million from 214.7 million in the December-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a user count of about 226 million.\nTwitter said Thursday that it had overstated its user base for nearly three years through the end of 2021 because of an error in how it accounted for people linked to multiple accounts. The company provided restated figures, including lowering its December quarter number to 214.7 million from 217 million.\nThe mistake \u201cis definitely another black eye for management at a time when Musk has already been pretty critical of them and their ability to execute,\u201d said Truist Securities analyst Youssef H. Squali.\nTwitter shares slipped 10 cents to $48.54 in morning trading; the stock is up 12% year to date. Mr. Musk\u2019s offer values Twitter at $54.20 a share.\nTwitter\u2019s revenue rose to $1.2 billion in the first quarter from $1.04 billion a year earlier. Analysts had forecast revenue of $1.23 billion, according to FactSet. Twitter noted headwinds associated with the war in Ukraine, which Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross found puzzling because Twitter is designed to disseminate news.\n\u201cTwitter should be benefiting from this. Why is that not happening?\u201d Mr. Ross said.\nAdvertising revenue increased 23% to $1.11 billion. The results come as its social-media peers such as Snap Inc. and Meta Platform Inc.\u2019s Facebook have seen their advertising sales dented by Apple Inc.\u2019s new privacy rules.\nTwitter reported earnings of $513 million, which included a pretax gain of $970 million from the sale of mobile ad firm MoPub to AppLovin Corp.\nTwitter said expenses in the quarter increased 35% and resulted in an operating loss of $128 million, compared with operating income of $52 million in the year-earlier quarter.\nTwitter\u2019s earnings report shows that the company is capable of improving engagement, but \u201cits financial execution against that usage is underwhelming,\u201d said Chas Cocke, founder and chief executive of hedge fund LB Partners LLC. Of the $100 million the firm manages, more than 10% was invested in the social-media company until Monday when it sold the shares.\n\u201cTwitter seems to be throwing headcount at the problem, which is leading to a bloated cost structure in relation to its revenue base,\u201d Mr. Cocke said. \u201cOne can imagine this is precisely the financial opportunity that Elon Musk sees.\u201d\nMr. Musk\u2019s deal for Twitter\u2014funded through bank debt and cash promised by the billionaire himself\u2014raises questions about the social-media company\u2019s financial footing. The transaction could nearly triple its leverage and saddle it with hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payable on the more than $25 billion used to fund the leveraged buyout.\nS&P Global Ratings said Tuesday that it expects the substantial increase in Twitter\u2019s leverage to lead to a potential multinotch downgrade of the company\u2019s credit rating, which currently is BB+, or below investment grade.\nTo service the debt, Mr. Musk will need to preserve Twitter\u2019s cash flow and grow it, which would be difficult without advertising. Mr. Musk has proposed changes for the company that include relying less on advertising. Ads currently account for around 90% of Twitter\u2019s revenue.\nTwitter introduced Twitter Blue, its first consumer subscription offering, to the U.S. market in November. Mr. Agrawal said on Twitter\u2019s last earnings call in February that Blue appeals to the company\u2019s \u201cmost heavy users\u201d but wasn\u2019t critical to achieving its 2023 revenue goal at the time.\nMr. Musk, should he take over the company, faces other challenges ahead. He has pledged to adopt a more hands-off approach to moderating speech on Twitter, saying in a tweet Monday that he wants the platform to be a destination for wide-ranging discourse and disagreement. On Tuesday, the internal market commissioner at the European Union cautioned that he would need to follow the bloc\u2019s new rules on content moderation.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-reports-higher-revenue-users-as-elon-musk-prepares-to-buy-it-11651147925?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral"}
