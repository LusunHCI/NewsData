    "title": "Biden approves 3000 additional troops to Eastern Europe",
    "maintext": "The Biden administration will deploy 3,000 forces to Eastern and Central Europe to bolster the \u201cdeterrence and defensive posture\u201d of NATO amid the backdrop of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon said Wednesday.\nPress secretary John Kirby announced that 1,000 US troops based in Germany will be shifted to Romania, joining 900 US forces already there. Of the remaining 2,000 forces, members of the 82nd Airborne and components of an Infantry Bridge Combat team will be sent to Poland, while members of the 18th Airborne Corps will be deployed to Germany.\n\u201cThese movements are unmistakable signals to the world that we stand ready to reassure our NATO allies and deter and defend against any aggression,\u201d Kirby told reporters.\n\u201cThe current situation demands that we reinforce the deterrence and defensive posture on NATO\u2019s eastern flank,\u201d he added. \u201cPresident Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe\u2019s security and stability. Our commitment to NATO Article Five and collective defense remains ironclad.\u201d\nArticle Five refers to the Atlantic alliance\u2019s policy that an attack on one of its members constitutes an attack on every member. Poland and Romania are both members of NATO and share borders with Ukraine.\n The troops going to Romania are part of a Stryker Squadron, a mounted cavalry unit designed to deploy quickly, and are being sent at the \u201cexpress invitation\u201d of the Bucharest government, according to Kirby.\nKirby insisted that the troop movements are not \u201cpermanent\u201d and are designed to respond to the \u201ccurrent security environment.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d he added, \u201cthese forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. \n The US forces are expected to be shipped out in the next few days, officials told the Wall Street Journal.\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that the US deployment was \u201cwelcome\u201d and \u201ca powerful signal of US commitment.\u201d\n\u201cOur deployments are defensive and proportional, and send the clear message that NATO will do whatever is necessary to protect and defend all Allies,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cAs we face a changed security environment, North America and Europe continue standing together in NATO, determined to keep our collective deterrence and defense [sic] strong.\u201d\nKirby said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has already deployed an estimated 100,000 troops and military equipment along Ukraine\u2019s borders, continues to add to his forces and has moved military personnel into Belarus.\n\u201cEven over just the last 24 hours, he continues to add in western Russia and Belarus and \u2026 in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic,\u201d the press secretary said. \u201cHe has shown no signs of being interested or willing to deescalate the tensions. And it\u2019s not just the United States that\u2019s noticed this. Our NATO allies have noticed this.\u201d\nMilitary personnel who are part of the new forces could also be used to help evacuate the approximately 30,000 Americans living in Ukraine, one official told the Journal.\nIf that happens, it\u2019s unlikely the troops would be sent inside Ukraine but instead would manage the operation along the Ukrainian border.\n\u201cOur troops are multi-mission capable and they will be prepared for a range of contingencies,\u201d Kirby told reporters when asked about the possibility Wednesday. \u201cI won\u2019t go any further than that.\u201d\nLast week, the US announced it had put 8,500 forces on \u201cheightened alert\u201d in the event they were needed as part of a 40,000-strong NATO Response Force. On Friday, Biden told reporters that \u201cI\u2019ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe and the NATO countries in the near term,\u201d before adding that the number would be \u201cnot too many.",
